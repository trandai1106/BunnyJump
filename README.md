# Bunny Jump
This is a project to get started with ***Phaser 3*** - a JS library for game programming.

## Reference Source
Almost the project is referenced in **Tommy Leung**'s free book [Infinite Jumper in Phaser 3 with Modern JavaScript](https://ourcade.co/books/infinite-jumper-phaser3/). 
This is a great book and suitable for beginners with Phaser as well as game development. 
You can see more about the original project [Bunny Jump](https://github.com/ourcade/infinite-jumper-template-phaser3) and the author [Tommy Leung](https://github.com/supertommy).

I'm developing some more features for the game, let's have a look.

## Demo
